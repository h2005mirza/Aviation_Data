✈️ Flight Data Extraction using AviationStack API
📘 Overview

This Python project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Python in web data extraction and API integration. Using the AviationStack API, the program retrieves real-time flight data and processes it into a clean, readable format.

By leveraging Python’s built-in libraries — urllib. request for handling HTTP requests and json for parsing data — this project serves as a simple yet effective introduction to real-world data handling in Python.

🧠 Project Structure
1. main.py

This script focuses on fetching raw JSON data directly from the AviationStack API.
It helps analyze the structure of the retrieved data so the parsing logic can be designed effectively.

2. parse.py

This script refines and processes the extracted JSON data into a structured, human-readable output.
It showcases how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Python.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

AviationStack API

urllib. request (for making API requests)

json (for parsing and formatting data)

🚀 Key Features

Fetches real-time flight information from the AviationStack API.

Demonstrates JSON data extraction and parsing using Python.

Provides clean and formatted outputs for easier data interpretation.

Acts as a foundation for more advanced data science or analytics projects.

💡 Future Improvements

Add error handling for network or API issues.

Store parsed data in a SQLite database.

Implement filtering or search functionality (e.g., by airline or destination).

Visualize data using Matplotlib or Plotly.
