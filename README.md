This is a Python project that is based on the cocnept of web data and data extraction. In this program, we use the AviationStack API to extract real-time flight data 
using Python libraries like urllib.request and JSON library. This is a basic yet powerful program that showcases the adaptibility and versatlity of Python programming 
langauge. 
There are two code files. The first one just extracts raw JSON data. Then we analyze the data for parsing and understanding.
The second one also extracts the data but it also parses it and prints the data in a very sequential and cleaned manner.
