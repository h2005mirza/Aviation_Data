This is a Python project that is based on the cocnept of web data and data extraction. In this program, we use the AviationStack API to extract real-time flight data 
using Python libraries like urllib.request and JSON library. This is a basic yet powerful program that showcases the adaptibility and versatlity of Python programming 
langauge. 
There are two files in this program. 
main.py - this file just extracts raw json data so that we can analyze it and devise the program according to it. 
parse.py - this file contains the code that not only prints the extracted data but in a cleaned and optimized manner.
